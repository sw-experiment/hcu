# Health Care Utilisation

## Software Experiments in Data Science using Health Care Utilisation Data

This is not intended for use as a tool or for academic research purposes.

It is a scratch area for learning R in the context of health data.

The repositroty name "hcu" is short for health care utilisation.

Experiments will be using R to wrangle, analyse, visualise and
hopefully gain insights from OECD health care utilisation data.

Other data sets may be included.
