# Software Experiments in Data Science using Health Care Utilisation Data

The repositroty name "hcu" is short for health care utilisation.

Experiments will be using R to wrangle, analyse, visualise and
hopefully gain insights from OECD health care utilisation data.

Other data sets may be included.
